- **`angle_servo.py`**  
  âž¤ Calculates the servo angles required to tilt the platform, based on the PID output.  
  âž¤ Converts tilt direction (`theta`) and magnitude (`phi`) into servo commands using inverse kinematics.

- **`pid.py`**  
  âž¤ Takes the ball's position from the camera and computes the PID output.  
  âž¤ Determines how much and in which direction the platform should tilt to bring the ball back to center.

- **`camera_axis.py`**  
  âž¤ Helps align the camera such that one of the servo arms (Arm 1) lies along the X-axis in the camera view.  
  âž¤ This script tells you how much to **virtually rotate** the camera view.  
  âž¤ The camera is **not physically rotated**â€”only the output angle is adjusted accordingly in the code.  
  âž¤ Also helps align the coordinate center to the actual center of the plate.

- **`code_camera.py`**  
  âž¤ Handles real-time video capture and HSV-based ball detection using the PiCamera.

- **`main.py`**  
  âž¤ Fully integrated code that combines camera input, PID control, angle computation, and servo output.  
  âž¤ This is the final script used to run the real-time ball-balancing system.
